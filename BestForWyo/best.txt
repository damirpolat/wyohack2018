Utilizing blockchain technology to record and manage the movement of goods and related
invoices will signi cantly mitigate
the risk of errors and the opportunity to alter invoice values or recipients.

Initial thought: Currently supply chains are kept within the specific companies,
leading to a lack of transparency and loss of revenue.
Research: Blockchain use in Wyoming, how it functions, companies using
Finger printing  the oil to determine quality, per day?
Oil down pipeline per hour, finger print each hour to check
Origin, mixture dilution
Coal - 2/5
'While coal is dying, blockchain would help maximize profits to help safeguard Wyoming'
Natural Gas shipped out through pipelines used in 3/5 households for heating
Natural gas in top five, coal >=1/3 of nation's
Seven of the 10 largest U.S. coal mines are located in Wyoming's Powder River Basin
Coal: 40% of U.S. production
 In 2013, Wyoming’s nonenergy mineral production was valued at over $2.26 billion.
 Notably, Wyoming produces more trona (the chief source of soda ash) than any other state,
 and the largest deposit of trona in the world sits under Sweetwater County in Wyoming.


 The U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA) cannot identify the origin of gasoline
sold at fueling stations. The gasoline a company sells is not necessarily produced by that company.
Gasoline brands get mixed during shipment
Gasoline is sold at more than 100,000 retail outlets across the nation, and many are unbranded
dealers that may sell gasoline produced by different companies.
Crude oil also gets mixed at the refinery
Even if EIA could determine the origin of the gasoline sold at fueling stations, the source of
the crude oil and other liquids used at refineries may vary. Most refiners use a mix of crude
oils from various domestic and foreign sources. The mix of crude oils can change based on the
relative cost and availability of crude oil from those sources

U.S. production reached more than 2.3 billion barrels per year in 2012.
The U.S. has 615 million barrels of storage capacity at refineries.
• The U.S. has 950 million barrels of storage capacity at bulk terminals.
• 89 million barrels can be stored in the product pipeline system.
143 refineries in the United States
• In 2012, U.S. refineries produced over 3.2 billion barrels of finished
motor gasoline.
Over 500 natural gas processing plants
o  Over 305,000 miles of natural gas pipeline o  Over 30 major market hubs
o  Over 400 storage facilities

2.3.3 Petroleum industry supply chain (SC) under uncertainties
Uncertainty exists where those involved do not have the knowledge they need
to accurately describe the current state of events or predict future outcomes. It
can impact on decision making in the supply chain if decision makers are
unclear about their objectives; if they lack information about the supply chain or

its environment, or they lack the capacity to process this information; if they are
unable to accurately predict the impact of possible control actions on supply
chain behaviours; or if they lack effective control actions Van der Vorst et al.
(2002). Uncertainty can be a long-term problem; for example, the effects of
fluctuations in the price of raw materials, market demand and production rates
may be felt for five to ten years Sahinidis et al. (1989). Mid-term uncertainties
may affect operations for one to two years (Gupta & Maranas, 2003), while
short-term uncertainties are day-to-day or week-to-week processing variations
(e.g. equipment failure or a cancelled order) that require an immediate response
Subrahmanyam et al. (1994).
It is extremely important that the petroleum processing industry plans for a high
degree of uncertainty. As highlighted above, the industry is subject to a number
of uncertainties, including variable reserves, production problems, and
fluctuations in the price of raw materials, refined products and market demand.
Investigating the effects of uncertainties in demand, market prices, raw material
costs and production yields on planning decisions in the petrochemical supply
chain, Lababidi et al. (2004) found the impact to be significant, with market
demand being the most important. Figure 2.7 shows how the effects of market
uncertainty are felt throughout the supply chain (Das, & Abdel-Malek, 2003).
